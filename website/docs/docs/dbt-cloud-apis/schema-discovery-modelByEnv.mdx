dbt Labs is making changes to the Discovery API. These changes will take effect on August 15, 2023.

The model by environment object is being deprecated and will be replaced with `environment { applied { modelHistoricalRuns } }`. When the time comes, you will need to update your API calls accordingly to avoid errors. Refer to the
[Environment object schema](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-schema-environment) for details.
:::

This model by environment object allows you to query information about a particular model based on `environmentId`.

The [Example query](#example-query) illustrates a few fields you can query in the `modelByEnvironment` object. Refer to [Fields](#fields) to see the entire schema, which provides all possible fields you can query.

```graphql
query{
  modelByEnvironment(environmentId: 834, uniqueId: "model.marketing.customers", lastRunCount: 20) {
    runId, # Get historical results for a particular model
    runGeneratedAt,
    executionTime, # View build time across runs
    status,
    tests { name, status, executeCompletedAt } # View test results across runs
  }
}
```
