import { QueryArgsTable, SchemaTable } from "./schema";


The models object allows you to query information about all models in a given job.

import DiscoveryApiJobDeprecationNotice from '/snippets/_discovery_api_job_deprecation_notice.md';

<DiscoveryApiJobDeprecationNotice />

### Arguments

When querying for `models`, the following arguments are available. If you don't include a runId, the API defaults to the most recent run of the specified job:

<QueryArgsTable queryName="models" />

Below we show some illustrative example queries and outline the schema of the models object.

### Example queries
The database, schema, and identifier arguments are optional. This means that with this endpoint you can:
- Find a specific model by providing `<database>.<schema>.<identifier>`
- Find all of the models in a database and/or schema by providing `<database>` and/or `<schema>`

#### Find models by their database, schema, and identifier
The example query below finds a model by its unique database, schema, and identifier.

```graphql
{
  models(jobId: 123, database:"analytics", schema: "analytics", identifier:"dim_customers") {
    uniqueId
  }
}
```

#### Find models by their schema
The example query below finds all models in this schema and their respective execution times.

```graphql
{
  models(jobId: 123, schema: "analytics") {
    uniqueId
    executionTime
  }
}
```


### Fields
The models object can access the _same fields_ as the [Model node](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-schema-model). The difference is that the models object can output a list so instead of querying for fields for one specific model, you can query for those parameters for all models within a jobID, database, and so on.

When querying for `models`, the following fields are available:

<SchemaTable nodeName="ModelNode" />
